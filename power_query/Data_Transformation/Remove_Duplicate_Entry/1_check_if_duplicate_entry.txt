# First u should check, if duplicate rows actually exists ??


# How to actually check if there is duplicate entry/rows/records or not ??

    1) First, from the data, identify which column is functioning like Primary Key is SQl.

        (i.e identify that column whose value can never be repeated)


    2) Now, select that column by clicking on column header.

    3) Navigate to 'Home' tab and click on "Group By" icon.

    4) A Group By 'Dialog' box will appear.

    5) U column already see the column which u have selected.

        In the 'New Column name', give the name, suppose "Count".

        In the "Operation" dropdown, choose the option "Count Rows".

        Click on "OK" button.
    
    6) U can see a sepereate new "Count" column being created.

    7) Now, click on "Count" column header dropdown icon.

        Here, u can clearly see the values:
            If only '1' numeric value is ticked, it means No Duplicate.
            Else if other numeric value is also ticked, it means there is Duplicate.

    
    8) After u click on column header dropdown:

        Click "Number Filters" and choose "Does Note Equals" from dropdown. 

        A "Filter Rows" dialog box will appear:
            --> on the right side of 'does not equal', write value '1'
            --> Click  on "OK" button.
        
            Now, u can clearly, see the duplicate values and their repeatition times.


Wallah !!
