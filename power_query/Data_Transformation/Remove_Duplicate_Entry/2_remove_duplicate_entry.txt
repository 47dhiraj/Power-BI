    1) First, from the data, identify which column is functioning like Primary Key column (i.e unique) like in SQl.

        (i.e identify that column whose value can never be repeated)

    
    2) Select the first column by clicking on it.


    3) Press and Hold the "Shift" key.

        --> Again, select last column by clicking on it.

        U can see all data being selected.
    

    4) Horizontally Scroll back to that column on the basis of which u want to remove duplicate entry/rows/records.

        --> 'Right click' on that 'column name/header' and choose "Remove Duplicates" from dropdown option.

    
        All the duplicates rows are being removed.


Wallah !!
