Suppose u want to filter out/remove  Rows/records based on some Text in that column.


# How to do Text Filtering ??

    1) Click on 'Dropdown' icon on that Column Header.

    2) Hover over "Text Filters" option.

    3) U can see multiple dropdown options:

        * Equals...
        * Does Not Equal...
        * Begins With...
        * Does Not Begins With...
        * Ends With...
        * Does Not Ends With...
        * Contains...
        * Does Not contain...
    

    4) Suppose i choose "Does Not Contains" option.

    5) A 'Filter Rows' dialog box will appear.

    6) In the box, right side to "does not contain" dropdown, write that particular word 'which' u don't want to see further.

    7) Click on "OK" button.


Wallah !!
