    1) At first, simply select the column that you want to split.


    2) Navigate to 'Home' tab in the Ribbon.


    3) Within the "Home" tab, find and click on "Split Column" option. 
        (NOTE: It may be under the "Transform" group)
    

    4) A dropdown menu will appear. Choose the appropriate option based on how you want to split the column:

        * By Delimiter: If your data is separated by a specific character (comma, space, :, =, Custom, (, ), etc.).         (This comes to handy many many times)

        * By Number of Characters: If you want to split the column into a specific number of characters.

        * At Positions: If you want to specify exact positions to split the column.

        * By Lowercase to Uppercase

        * By Uppercase to Lowercase

        * By Digit to Non-Digit             (this comes to handy)

        * By Non-Digit to Digit             (this comes to handy)


    5) U also have to choose the option like:

        * "Split at":
                        --> Left-most delimiter
                        --> Right-most delimiter
                        --> Each occurence of the delimiter


    6) Finally, click on 'OK' button.
