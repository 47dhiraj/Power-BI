# "New Group" or "New Data Group" is one of the best way to create Groups/Buckets.


#  How to create a "New Group" ?

    1) On the right side of the "Data" Pane, u can see "table".

    2) Two ways to create a New Group:

        1st way:

            Inside 'table', right click on that 'column' which u want to group.
            --> From dropdown option choose "New group" by clicking it.
    

        2nd way:

            Single left click on that 'column' and on the Ribbon, inside 'Column tools' tab,
            u can see 'Data Groups'.

            --> Click on 'Data Groups' and choose 'New data groups' by clicking it.
        

    3) A "Group" dialog box will appear.

        --> In 'Name', give the name of the group column.

        --> In 'Group Type' it is good to choose 'List' rather than the 'Bin'.

            Beacuse, List works on both text and numeric value,
            But, Bin works only on numeric  value.

        --> The 'Field' is ur selected column on basis of which u want to apply grouping.

        --> Now, manually select all the values, which u want to create a single group.
            And, repeat this process.

        --> Rename all those created groups by double clicking.

        --> Click on "OK" button.


Wallah !!
