CALCULATE is used when you want to control or change how a calculation is done based on specific conditions or applying some filters.



SYNTAX:

    Measure = CALCULATE(<expression>, <filter1>, <filter2>, ..)


Updated Shorter SYNTAX:

    Measure = [expression](<filter1>)




EXAMPLE 1 : 

    America Shipment = CALCULATE([Shipment Count], locations[Region]= "Americas")

    Here,
        Shipment Count is a Measure (i.e a Measure returns scalar/single value).
        locations[Region] is a table column (returns multiple values)



EXAMPLE 2 :

    Affiliate Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], Sales[Channel] = "Affiliate")

    Here,
        Total Sales is a Measure which gives scalar/single value.
